# Image-Matching-Python-Script

# First I have install Selenium in Ubuntu:
#   - sudo install selenium

# Then I have installed BeautifulSoup:
#   - sudo apt-get install python3-bs4

# Then I have followed a document for installing the webdriver:
#   - https://tecadmin.net/setup-selenium-chromedriver-on-ubuntu/

# Image Matching steps-
- First, I have used the web driver to achieve the search url. 
- Then, took another variable for the keyword or the search tags. 
- Afterthat, I have used BeautifulSoup for parsing and scraping the HTML page.
- And I have also created the image tag list using which I have created other two lists of
  image urls and image alt(alternate text of an area).
